Abstract:
With the increasing dependence on the internet for various activities, the threat of malware infections has become a significant concern. Malware, including viruses, trojans, and ransomware, can compromise the security and privacy of users' sensitive data and lead to financial losses. To address this issue, this project proposes the development of a "Malware Detecting Extension," a browser-based tool designed to enhance cybersecurity by identifying and blocking potential malware threats before they can infiltrate users' systems.
